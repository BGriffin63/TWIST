# TWIST Web Project

This Github repository will contain all of the files necessary to build/run the TWIST website including both the database and the user interface.

The repository has several different branches for building and testing:

- main
- testing
- database
- website
- styles

Feel free to add more branches to the repository as you see fit.  
For example, if you need a branch to test a new feature or design but don't want to mess with code in a given branch, you can easily add a branch off of  
another then create a pull request when done to bring it back to the original branch.

**DO NOT DIRECTLY COMMIT TO MAIN**  
This can cause problems with code that has been verified to work. The main branch is for the final product and should be *mostly* bug free.  
We will only pull code into main once we as a group decide that it is good enough to pull from the testing branch.

This README file will be replaced with an overview of the project when we submit the final build.
